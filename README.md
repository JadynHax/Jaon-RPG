# Jaon-RPG
This is a game thing I'm planning on making, used by interacting with the user on the command line. Unfinished atm.

## Mechanics
The mechanics for this will be fairly simple, but hopefully unique enough to provide some good gameplay. Current mechanics include:
- Intelligent typo correction when performing actions.
- Colored and accurate entity health bars in combat.

### Planned Mechanics
- Varying spells with unique effects.
- Unique classes for varied gameplay.
- Ability to save progress, so you can set the game down and come back to it later if need be.
- Roguelike-like metaprogression options, including but not limited to:
  - New class unlocks when reaching certain milestones
  - New items when beating certain bosses / milestones
  - New skills or abilities when "leveling up" each class by using them enough
